OFTC Modified Version of qwebirc -- it uses socket.io at leafs instead of
relying on the twisted server.

see js/irc/ircconnection.js for customization.

Installation instructions are on the website:

If you'd like to make modifications you'd find it a LOT
easier if you symlink:

js -> static/js/debug
css -> static/css/debug

... then you can browse to http://instance/quidebug.html
and use your favourite javascript debugger, as well as
not having to compile each time you make a change!
