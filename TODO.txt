UI:
  FEAT: tab dragging
  FEAT: [ ] style flashing
  TIDY: [enter] in text box should trigger event instead of having a form there?
  FEAT: Save last nick/chans in cookies.
  FEAT: multiline pastes
  FEAT: link options, about and embedded wizard somewhere more obvious.
  FEAT: Last position line
  TIDY: warning/info messages should have their colour decided by CSS
  FEAT: privacy policy
  TIDY: connect dialog offset looks non-centred
  
Authing:
  TIDY: Finish integration (notably login button on non-autoconnect page).
  TIDY: Login button should save state on form.
  TIDY: Fix up state inconsistency if backend is restarted (state is stored in user cookie and not refreshed except on login).
  FEAT: bind qticket to session to prevent ticket reuse within time limit.
  FEAT: on startup: if autojoin channels exist and Q invites then the autojoin channels should be focused rather than the Q invited ones.
  
IRC:  
  TIDY: /msg $ goes to status, as does /notice $, should go to active.
  
Options pane:
  FEAT: Store options server side when logged in.
